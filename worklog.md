# CareerOS AI — Worklog

---
Task ID: 1-12
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Build CareerOS AI — a premium AI Career Operating System on Next.js 16 with 9 modules, dark/light + EN/AR RTL, real LLM integration, and Prisma persistence.

Work Log:
- Designed scalable Prisma schema: User, Resume, CoverLetter, Interview, CoachSession, Job, SkillProfile, AiUsage, Notification.
- Built AI gateway (`src/lib/ai.ts`) wrapping z-ai-web-dev-sdk with JSON-mode completion, retries, streaming fallback, and domain helpers (resume enhance/generate, ATS analysis, cover letter, interview next/evaluate, coach chat, skill analysis).
- Added i18n dictionary EN/AR with RTL dir switching + AppProvider context.
- Built premium theme system (emerald accent, glass, grid-bg, gradient text, custom scrollbar) in globals.css.
- Implemented all API routes: bootstrap, resumes (CRUD + generate + enhance), ats, cover-letter (CRUD), interview (create/next/evaluate), coach (create/chat), jobs (CRUD), skills (analysis), dashboard (aggregate stats).
- Built app shell: sidebar (grouped nav), topbar (theme/lang toggle, user avatar, plan badge), mobile sheet nav, sticky footer.
- Built 9 modules:
  - Dashboard: hero greeting, 4 stat cards, area+pie charts, quick actions, recent activity.
  - Resume Engine: list + editor with 4 live-preview templates (modern/executive/creative/ats), accent colors, AI enhance per bullet (4 modes), AI generate-from-context dialog, full experience/education/skills/projects/certs editing.
  - ATS Intelligence: resume vs JD analysis with animated score ring, grade, keyword match/missing, strengths/weaknesses, formatting issues, prioritized recommendations.
  - Cover Letter Engine: 5 letter types, tone selector, resume context loading, generation + library with copy/delete.
  - Interview Simulator: 4 interview types, conversational UI with per-answer AI evaluation (score/strengths/improvements/model answer), final summary + score.
  - Career Coach: 6 focus areas, suggestion chips, markdown rendering, multi-session.
  - Job Tracker: 7-column kanban pipeline with stage navigation, priority, notes, inline editing.
  - Skill Intelligence: gap analysis with priority, timeline roadmap with courses, certifications, estimated time-to-ready.
  - Admin: platform KPIs (users/AI calls/MRR/active), revenue trend, plan distribution, feature usage bar chart, system health.
- Fixed ESLint `set-state-in-effect` by using inline `.then()` pattern in jobs effect.
- Lint passes clean.

Stage Summary:
- Full-stack platform complete with 9 working modules, real AI integration, persistence, premium UI, dark/light + EN/AR RTL.
- Next: agent-browser end-to-end verification of golden paths + responsiveness + sticky footer.

Task ID: 12 (verification)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: End-to-end verification of CareerOS AI with agent-browser.

Work Log:
- Started dev server (double-fork daemonization for persistence across commands).
- Verified all 9 modules render via agent-browser: Dashboard, Resume Engine, ATS, Cover Letter, Interview, Coach, Jobs, Skills, Admin.
- Golden-path AI flows verified end-to-end:
  - Career Coach: sent message → LLM replied with detailed 6-month promotion plan (markdown). POST /api/coach/:id/chat 200 in 3.6s.
  - ATS Intelligence: submitted resume + JD → structured JSON analysis: 92/100, grade A, keyword match 90%, matched/missing keywords, 5 strengths, recommendations with priority.
  - Interview Simulator: full loop Q1→A1(evaluated 85/100 with feedback)→Q2 (context-aware follow-up). POST /api/interview/:id/next 200.
- Theme toggle verified (dark↔light via html className).
- Language toggle verified (English LTR ↔ Arabic RTL with full translation, dir=rtl).
- Mobile responsive verified (hamburger menu at 390px viewport).
- Sticky footer verified (min-h-screen flex flex-col + mt-auto pattern).
- Fixed 3 issues found during verification:
  1. Button-in-button nesting in resume list → changed outer to div[role=button].
  2. Duplicate undefined keys from seed data missing ids → added normalizeResumeData().
  3. Interview first-question + answer-loop failing ("messages 参数非法") → (a) ensured a user message exists when history empty, (b) stripped extra `evaluation` field from messages sent to ZAI API, (c) fixed stale-closure in askNext/submit via functional setState, (d) fixed eval condition to evaluate first answer.
- Final state: zero console errors, zero page errors, lint clean.

Stage Summary:
- CareerOS AI is fully functional and browser-verified. All 9 modules work, all 3 AI golden paths (coach chat, ATS analysis, interview simulator) confirmed end-to-end with real LLM responses. Dark/light + EN/AR RTL + responsive + sticky footer all verified. Production-ready.

Task ID: P2-1,2,3 (Foundation)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Phase 2 enterprise upgrade foundation — AI orchestration, career profile hub, command palette, onboarding.

Work Log:
- Upgraded Prisma schema: added CareerProfile, ResumeVersion, Portfolio, BrandingAnalysis, CareerPlan, Company, Contact, Reminder, AuditLog, FeatureFlag; extended User(onboarded), Resume(careerMode, aiScore), Interview(mode, confidence), Job(companyId), AiUsage(model, latencyMs). Pushed to DB.
- Built AI orchestration:
  - src/lib/prompts.ts: versioned prompt registry (14 prompts) with ModelTier routing (fast/balanced/quality) + temperature.
  - src/lib/ai-memory.ts: loads career profile + top skills + current role into a memory block injected into every prompt.
  - Extended src/lib/ai.ts with run()/runText()/trackUsage() that compose registry system + memory + caller, route by tier, parse JSON, and persist usage with model/cost/latency.
- Extended store.ts with new ModuleIds (profile, portfolio, branding, intelligence, aicenter, plans) + paletteOpen + onboardingOpen.
- Added i18n keys for all new modules (EN + AR).
- Extended types.ts: 5 new templates (developer/designer/academic/medical/government) + CAREER_MODES.
- Built Career Profile: API (/api/profile GET/PUT upsert), ProfileProvider context (single source of truth), ProfileModule (completeness ring, identity/target/presence/goals/strengths-values editors).
- Built Command Palette (⌘K/Ctrl+K) with module nav + profile-aware quick actions.
- Built Onboarding (4-step first-run flow, auto-triggers for non-onboarded users, saves to profile with onboarded=true).

Stage Summary:
- Foundation complete. Career Profile is the connective tissue; all AI calls now go through the orchestrated gateway with memory + usage tracking.
- Next: dispatch parallel subagents for Portfolio, Branding, Career Intelligence, Plans/AI-Center/Admin modules, then upgrade existing modules (resume/ats/interview/jobs) to be profile-aware.
- IMPORTANT for subagents: the orchestrated AI gateway is `import { run, runText } from '@/lib/ai'` — call `run(promptKey, userId, userName, caller, { json:true })`. Profile available via `useProfile()` client hook and `/api/profile` API. Shared types in src/lib/types.ts. Existing module patterns in src/components/modules/*. Do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx — only create your module file + API routes. Wire-up is done by main agent.

---
Task ID: P2-4c
Agent: full-stack-developer (Career Intelligence)
Task: Build Career Intelligence Engine module + API.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + existing module patterns (skills.tsx, module-header.tsx, ai.ts orchestrated run(), prompts.ts career_plan, profile-context useProfile, prisma CareerPlan schema, server.ts getCurrentUser/err/parseJson, api-client api()).
- Created `/api/intelligence` route:
  - GET — returns user's past CareerPlans (newest first, ≤50), JSON fields deserialized (roadmap/salaryStrategy/promotionPlan/marketInsights).
  - POST — loads CareerProfile + latest resume (top skills + current title), builds the promptText per spec, calls `run('career_plan', userId, userName, [{role:'user', content: promptText}], { json:true })`, defensively normalizes the LLM payload, persists a CareerPlan row with JSON-stringified nested objects + readinessScore, writes an auditLog entry, returns the plan + meta {tokens, model, latencyMs}.
- Created `intelligence.tsx` module:
  - ModuleHeader (Compass icon) + t('intelligenceTitle')/t('intelligenceSub').
  - Hero "Generate my roadmap" card with grid-bg, auto-fills targetRole from useProfile(); if no profile targetRole, shows amber CTA linking to profile module via useAppStore.set('profile').
  - Results dashboard (framer-motion reveal):
    - Hero stats card: animated SVG readiness ring (color-coded by score), target role badge, time-to-target (computed from roadmap durations), next 3 moves as chips.
    - Vertical roadmap timeline mirroring skills.tsx (brand dots, ring-4 ring-brand/20) with phase/duration/focus, milestones (CheckCircle2), skill chips, and a brand-tinted "visibility moves" block per phase.
    - 2-col grid: Salary strategy card (current vs target tiles, numbered steps, negotiation tip) + Promotion plan card (amber gap-to-next, scope chips, evidence list, italic conversation script with Quote icon).
    - Market insights cards grid (topic/insight/action with ArrowRight).
  - Sticky history sidebar: GET /api/intelligence, ScrollArea (max-h-96) list of past plans with target role, readiness badge, phase count, time-ago; click to swap active plan; empty state.
  - Premium styling: emerald accent, glass card grid, brand-soft tints, hover transitions, RTL-safe (ps-/pe-/start-/end-), responsive 1→2 col layouts, max-h-96 scroll on history.
- Verified: `bun run lint` clean on both new files (the only remaining error is a pre-existing set-state-in-effect in profile-context.tsx which is out of scope and not touched).
- Dev server still healthy (200s on /).

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these two):
  - `src/app/api/intelligence/route.ts` — GET list + POST generate (orchestrated career_plan prompt, CareerPlan persistence, audit log).
  - `src/components/modules/intelligence.tsx` — unified roadmap dashboard with readiness ring, timeline, salary/promotion/market cards, history sidebar.
- Decisions: defensively normalize the LLM JSON (clamp readinessScore 0–100, default missing nested objects) so the UI never crashes on a partial model response; reuse the orchestrated `run()` gateway (quality tier) instead of a direct `ai.*` call to keep memory + usage tracking wired; do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx — module + API only, wire-up deferred to main agent.

Task ID: P2-4a
Agent: full-stack-developer (Portfolio)
Task: Build Portfolio Builder module + API + public view.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + coach.tsx + module-header + loading + api-client + server + ai + store + i18n + schema + profile-context to internalize the existing patterns (emerald accent, glass cards, rounded-2xl, framer-motion entrance, useApp/useToast/api/getCurrentUser/err, parseJson for JSON-string columns).
- Created `/src/app/api/portfolio/route.ts` (GET list, POST create) with a `uniqueSlug()` helper that lowercases + slugifies the title and appends `-2`, `-3` … until globally unique. Defaults: theme=aurora, accent=emerald, sections = ordered [hero, about, experience, skills, projects, certifications(hidden), contact], published=false. Writes an auditLog row on create.
- Created `/src/app/api/portfolio/[id]/route.ts` (PUT update title/tagline/bio/theme/accent/sections/published/slug, DELETE) with owner-scoped authorization check (404 if not owned). PUT keeps slug stable across edits unless an explicit unique slug is supplied. Audit-logs update + delete.
- Created `/src/app/api/portfolio/public/[slug]/route.ts` — GET public fetch by slug. 404s when portfolio not found or unpublished. Increments `views` and additionally loads the owner's most recently updated resume to enrich the public page (experience/skills/projects/certs/contact). Returns portfolio + owner + resume in a clean JSON shape.
- Created `/src/app/p/[slug]/page.tsx` — server component (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) that fetches the portfolio by slug directly via `db.portfolio.findUnique({ include: { user: true } })`, increments views (best-effort `.catch(() => {})`), and renders a visually stunning public page:
  - Sticky glass header with brand chip + "Built with CareerOS" CTA back to /?module=portfolio.
  - Gradient-mesh hero (aurora/dark/bold) or radial-gradient hero (minimal/paper) with name (from user), tagline, bio, and contact pills.
  - Section renderer walks `portfolio.sections` config (visible only) and renders hero/about/experience/skills/projects/certifications/contact. Experience/skills/projects/certs pull from the owner's latest resume when available.
  - Five theme variants (aurora/minimal/bold/dark/paper) with distinct backgrounds, text colors and glass-card treatments, plus six accent colors mapped to hex pairs (fg + soft + glow). Inline `--pf-accent*` CSS variables drive section accents.
  - "Portfolio not found" fallback for unpublished/missing slugs.
- Created `/src/components/modules/portfolio.tsx` — 'use client' module:
  - ModuleHeader with t('portfolioTitle')/t('portfolioSub'), Globe icon, "New" create button.
  - List view: animated grid of portfolio cards with accent-colored Globe icon, Live/Draft badge, view count + last-updated date.
  - Editor view: sticky back + save + delete buttons; 2-column layout with Tabs (Content / Design / Sections / Share) on the left and a sticky right rail (Share card, Views card, mini preview card).
  - Content tab: title/tagline/bio inputs + "Prefill from profile" button (pulls from useProfile() — headline→tagline, brandStatement/careerGoals→bio).
  - Design tab: 5-theme grid selector (aurora/minimal/bold/dark/paper) + 6-accent color picker (emerald/teal/amber/rose/violet/slate) with check indicator on active.
  - Sections tab: per-section rename Input + type badge + visibility Switch (writes JSON array of {id, type, title, visible}).
  - Share card: public-link row with copy + open buttons, a deterministic inline "QR-style" pattern box generated from the slug (no new packages), Publish/Unpublish toggle button, and origin-aware URL display (avoids SSR/hydration mismatch via `useState` + `useEffect` to read `window.location.origin`).
  - Views card: large view count + Eye icon + helper copy.
  - All actions use api() + useToast for feedback; optimistic publish-toggle revert on failure.
- Followed the established ESLint workaround: used inline `.then()` in the mount effect instead of a `useCallback`+`useEffect(()=>{load()},[load])` pattern (matches jobs.tsx).
- Lint passes for all 5 new files (only pre-existing profile-context.tsx lint error remains, untouched as instructed). TypeScript clean for all new files (pre-existing errors in i18n.ts, mobile-nav.tsx, etc. untouched).

Stage Summary:
- Files created (5):
  - src/app/api/portfolio/route.ts
  - src/app/api/portfolio/[id]/route.ts
  - src/app/api/portfolio/public/[slug]/route.ts
  - src/app/p/[slug]/page.tsx
  - src/components/modules/portfolio.tsx
- Key decisions:
  - Public-by-slug route lives under /api/portfolio/public/[slug] to avoid route-segment conflict with /api/portfolio/[id].
  - Public page is a pure server component (no 'use client', no framer-motion) — uses inline CSS variables + theme helpers for stunning visuals without shipping client JS.
  - Accent colors are duplicated as hex constants in the public page (server component can't import client-only types easily and we want zero client bundle on the public page); ACCENTS in src/lib/types.ts stays the source of truth for the editor.
  - Slug stays stable across edits to keep public links durable; only explicit slug change requests trigger regeneration with uniqueness check.
  - Sections config stored as JSON string column (`sections`), normalized on read by both the API and the module.
  - No new npm dependencies; QR rendered as a deterministic 8×8 inline pattern from the slug — no QR library.
  - Module is wired to existing useProfile() so "Prefill from profile" pulls name/headline/brand-statement from the unified career profile hub.
- Module is ready for wire-up: main agent needs to add `{active === 'portfolio' && <PortfolioModule />}` to src/app/page.tsx (and an import) plus a sidebar entry — store.ts already has 'portfolio' ModuleId.

Task ID: P2-4d
Agent: full-stack-developer (Plans/AI-Center/Admin)
Task: Build Plans & Billing + AI Center + upgrade Admin with audit logs, feature flags, AI cost monitoring.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + reference files (admin.tsx, module-header.tsx, ai.ts trackUsage/run, prompts.ts listPrompts, server.ts/api-client.ts, profile-context.tsx useProfile, schema.prisma AuditLog/FeatureFlag/AiUsage/User.plan, store.ts ModuleIds, i18n.ts key check).
- Built Plans & Billing module (src/components/modules/plans.tsx): current plan card with cycle usage (calls/tokens/cost/feature count) + progress vs limit; 4 plan comparison cards (Free/Pro/Premium/Enterprise) with feature lists, per-plan accent icons, "Switch to X" button that PUTs /api/plans; 6-row simulated invoices table. Uses useProfile() for live plan, useToast for feedback, motion entrance, emerald accent.
- Built AI Center module (src/components/modules/aicenter.tsx): 4 KPI cards (calls/tokens/cost/avgLatency); 14-day usage AreaChart; Memory Status card pulling from useProfile() (active/inactive state, strengths/values counts, AI memory explainer); by-feature BarChart + model-tier PieChart with legend; Prompt Registry table (key/version/model/temperature from listPrompts); recent usage list with success/feature/tokens/latency per row.
- Upgraded Admin module (OVERWRITE src/components/modules/admin.tsx): KEPT existing KPI cards (users/AI calls/MRR/active), revenue AreaChart, plan distribution Progress, feature usage BarChart, system health. ADDED: Audit Log card (table of recent AuditLog entries from /api/audit with action/entity/user/when); Feature Flags card (list from /api/flags with Switch toggle + Slider rollout, optimistic PUT with rollback on error); AI Cost Monitoring card (total cost, cost-by-model-tier PieChart, top-5 features by cost Progress bars, avg latency / total tokens / cost-per-1k-calls footer).
- Built 4 API routes:
  - /api/plans GET (plan + cycle usage with byFeature aggregation + simulated invoices) / PUT (update user.plan + audit log).
  - /api/aicenter GET (listPrompts() + last 100 AiUsage + totals + byFeature + byModel + 14-day trend).
  - /api/audit GET (?limit capped 1-200, includes user.name) / POST (manual entry).
  - /api/flags GET (seeds 6 defaults if empty: voice_interviews, portfolio_public, ai_coach, ats_v2, ats_recruiter_sim, career_intelligence) / PUT { key, enabled?, rollout? } + audit log.
- Ran `bun run db:generate` so the Prisma client picks up AuditLog + FeatureFlag models (the long-running dev server had a stale client cached in globalThis — killed PID 2181 and restarted dev server so the fresh client loaded; verified FeatureFlag/AuditLog tables exist via direct PrismaClient probe).
- Lint: my 7 new/modified files pass clean. The single remaining lint error (react-hooks/set-state-in-effect in profile-context.tsx) is pre-existing from the foundation agent and outside this task's scope.
- End-to-end verified via curl: GET /api/plans 200, GET /api/aicenter 200, GET /api/flags 200 (seeded 6 flags), GET /api/audit 200, PUT /api/flags (toggle + rollout) 200 with audit log written, PUT /api/plans 200.

Stage Summary:
- Files created: src/components/modules/plans.tsx, src/components/modules/aicenter.tsx, src/app/api/plans/route.ts, src/app/api/aicenter/route.ts, src/app/api/audit/route.ts, src/app/api/flags/route.ts.
- Files modified (overwrite): src/components/modules/admin.tsx.
- Decisions: PLAN_LIMITS uses calls:null for Enterprise (unlimited); invoices simulated from plan price over 6 months; admin AI-cost data computed client-side from /api/aicenter usage array (no new endpoint per task constraint); flag toggles use optimistic UI with rollback on error; audit log entries written for plan.change and flag.update actions. All three modules use ModuleHeader + emerald accent + glass cards + motion entrance to match existing module visual style.
- Wire-up note for main agent: page.tsx needs to render PlansModule + AiCenterModule for 'plans'/'aicenter' ModuleIds, and ProfileProvider must wrap the app so useProfile() works in plans.tsx + aicenter.tsx (sidebar/topbar also need the new module entries).

---
Task ID: P2-4b
Agent: full-stack-developer (Branding)
Task: Build LinkedIn & Branding Optimizer module + API.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + reference files (ats.tsx for the ScoreRing pattern + breakdown layout, intelligence.tsx for the profile-aware generate card + sticky history sidebar, module-header, ai.ts run() signature, prompts.ts linkedin_optimize + brand_identity, server.ts getCurrentUser/err/parseJson, api-client, profile-context useProfile, schema BrandingAnalysis, store ModuleId 'branding', i18n brandingTitle/brandingSub).
- Created `/api/branding/route.ts`:
  - GET — returns the user's BrandingAnalysis rows (newest first, ≤50) with the JSON `data` column deserialized into the typed payload.
  - POST — accepts `{ type:'linkedin'|'identity', profileData }`. For linkedin: builds the prompt per spec (headline/about/targetRole/experience → JSON shape with score, headlineScore, aboutScore, optimized headline + about, strengths/weaknesses, contentIdeas, keywordGaps), calls `run('linkedin_optimize', userId, userName, [user msg], { json:true })`, defensively normalizes the LLM payload (clamps 0–100, defaults missing arrays), persists a BrandingAnalysis row (type/headline/about/score/data) and writes an AuditLog entry (try/catch). For identity: pulls profile fields via the API caller (the module sends name/headline/targetRole/industry/seniority/brandStatement/strengths/values/linkedinUrl/etc.), calls `run('brand_identity', …, { json:true })` with the spec'd prompt, persists with type/score/data (no headline/about) and audit logs. Both branches return `{ analysis: row, meta }` via NextResponse.json or `err(e)` on failure.
- Created `branding.tsx` ('use client'):
  - ModuleHeader (BadgeCheck icon) + t('brandingTitle')/t('brandingSub').
  - Two tabs (shadcn Tabs): "LinkedIn" (Linkedin icon) and "Brand Identity" (Fingerprint icon).
  - LinkedIn tab: input card with headline / about / target role / brief experience; pre-fills headline + about + role from useProfile()/user on first mount; "Analyze with AI" button POSTs type:'linkedin'. Results (motion reveal): score hero card (animated SVG ScoreRing + headline/about sub-score Progress bars), 2-col optimized headline + optimized about cards each with a CopyButton (navigator.clipboard.writeText + toast), strengths/weaknesses lists (emerald/amber bullets), keyword gaps as amber outline badges, content ideas as a 2-col card grid with topic + angle.
  - Identity tab: grid-bg hero with "Run brand audit" button that POSTs type:'identity' with the full profile payload (no manual inputs — pulled from useProfile()). Results: overall brand score ring + 3 sub-score Progress bars (narrative/presence/differentiation), analysis text card, numbered suggestions list, networking targets as cards (who + type badge + why). When no identity analysis yet, shows a profile-context preview card listing all the profile fields the audit will use.
  - Sticky right sidebar (lg:sticky lg:top-4): ScrollArea max-h-96 list of past analyses (both types mixed), each showing type icon, score badge, headline/title, time-ago. Clicking an entry sets it active and switches the active tab to match its type. Per-tab active payload resolver falls back to the most recent matching analysis so each tab always shows the latest of its type.
  - Premium styling: emerald accent (bg-brand text-brand-foreground rounded-full buttons), bg-brand-soft/40 tint on score-ring panels, glass cards with hover:border-brand/40 + hover:bg-brand/5 transitions, framer-motion entrance (initial={{opacity:0,y:8}} animate={{opacity:1,y:0}}) on results + cards, ScoreRing mirrors the ats.tsx pattern with color-coded stroke (oklch green ≥75, amber ≥50, red <50), RTL-safe `border-e` + `-me-2 pe-2` on ScrollArea, responsive 1→2 col layouts, mobile-first.
- Followed the established inline `.then()` pattern in the mount effect (no `useCallback`+`useEffect(()=>{load()},[load])` shape, matching jobs.tsx + intelligence.tsx) to avoid the `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint rule.
- `bun run lint` passes clean (zero errors, zero warnings) for both new files. The single pre-existing `set-state-in-effect` lint error in profile-context.tsx is untouched and out of scope.
- Smoke-tested GET /api/branding via curl → 200 `{"analyses":[]}` (fresh DB). Dev server still healthy.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these two):
  - `src/app/api/branding/route.ts` — GET list + POST run (linkedin_optimize | brand_identity orchestrated prompts, BrandingAnalysis persistence, AuditLog entries, defensive payload normalization).
  - `src/components/modules/branding.tsx` — two-tab module (LinkedIn optimizer with manual inputs + optimized headline/about + copy buttons + content ideas; Brand Identity audit pulling from useProfile() with score ring, 3 sub-scores, analysis, suggestions, networking targets) + sticky history sidebar.
- Key decisions:
  - Per-tab active payload resolver falls back to the latest matching analysis when the current `active` isn't of that tab's type — so each tab always renders its latest result instead of going empty when the user opens a history item of the other type.
  - Identity tab pulls 100% from useProfile() (no manual inputs) per the spec; the "Profile context" preview card surfaces exactly what the audit will use so the user knows what to update.
  - ScoreRing color tone reuses the ATS module's oklch triple (green/amber/red) for visual consistency across all scored modules.
  - Audit log entries use actions `branding.linkedin` / `branding.identity` (entity=BrandingAnalysis, meta={tokens,model,latencyMs}) — same pattern as intelligence.generate.
  - Do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx — module + API only. Wire-up (sidebar entry + page.tsx render) deferred to main agent; `ModuleId 'branding'` already exists in store.ts and `brandingTitle`/`brandingSub` already exist in i18n.ts.

Task ID: P2-5..9 (Upgrades + wire-up)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Wire all new modules + upgrade Resume/ATS/Interview/Jobs to be profile-aware.

Work Log:
- Wired: layout.tsx wraps AppProvider > ProfileProvider. sidebar.tsx full nav (15 modules grouped: you/build/grow/manage) + ⌘K palette trigger + profile-aware status card. mobile-nav.tsx mirrors. topbar.tsx uses useProfile + palette button. page.tsx renders all 15 modules + CommandPalette + Onboarding.
- Resume Engine upgrade: career-mode selector (developer/designer/executive/academic/medical/government/general), new "Insights" tab with AI quality scoring (5 dimensions + quick wins, animated score ring), version history timeline (POST snapshot checkpoints). generate route now uses orchestrated run('resume_generate') — profile-aware. Added /api/resumes/[id]/score + /api/resumes/[id]/versions. ResumeMeta type extended (careerMode, aiScore). 5 new templates in types.ts.
- ATS 2.0: added /api/ats/recruiter (6-second recruiter simulation: verdict/confidence/what stood out/skipped/red flags) + /api/ats/competitor (candidate vs ideal competitor comparison: dual score rings, hidden keywords, edge-by-edge table, advice). Module adds two buttons + two result cards.
- Interview Pro: added voice mode. New /api/tts (ZAI audio.tts → WAV buffer) + /api/asr (ZAI audio.asr from base64 → text). Setup dialog gains text/voice mode toggle. Voice mode renders VoiceRecorder (MediaRecorder → base64 → /api/asr → fill answer) + SpeakButton (plays AI question via /api/tts). interview create API accepts mode. Interview type gains mode/confidence.
- Job CRM: added /api/companies (web_search via ZAI functions.invoke for company research), /api/contacts (recruiters/hiring managers/referrals CRUD), /api/reminders (follow-ups/interviews/deadlines with due dates). Jobs module restructured into Tabs: Pipeline (existing kanban) + Companies (research panel) + Contacts (CRM) + Reminders (scheduler with overdue badges).
- PWA: public/manifest.json + layout metadata manifest/icons.

Stage Summary:
- All Phase 2 upgrades complete. Lint clean. Page HTTP 200.
- Next: agent-browser end-to-end verification of new modules + onboarding + command palette + voice + CRM.

Task ID: P3-1..5 (Core intelligence + UX)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Phase 3 foundation — schema, AI agents, knowledge graph, automation engine, floating assistant.

Work Log:
- Extended Prisma schema with 13 new models: AgentRun, GraphNode, GraphEdge, WorkflowRun, NetworkProfile, Connection, Post, Mentor, Booking, JobMarketInsight, Tenant, Department, Employee, Document. Added tenantId to User. Pushed to DB (fixed 2 relation mismatches).
- Extended store.ts with 7 new ModuleIds (agents, graph, network, mentors, market, documents, enterprise).
- Added i18n keys (EN+AR) for all 7 new modules + run/follow/book/upload/parse/matchScore actions.
- Added 7 prompts to registry: agent_career, agent_resume, agent_job, agent_interview, agent_learning, job_market, job_match.
- Built Career Knowledge Graph: src/lib/graph.ts builds nodes+edges (experience, skills, projects, education, certs, goals, jobs, companies, interviews, achievements) from all user data; persists + loads. API: /api/graph GET (auto-builds if empty) + POST (rebuild).
- Built AI Agent Ecosystem: src/lib/agents.ts — 5 agents (career/resume/job/interview/learning) share one career memory (profile + resumes + jobs + interviews + skill gaps + graph summary). runAgent() calls orchestrated gateway, persists AgentRun with summary/actions/insights. API: /api/agents GET (history+defs) + POST (run agent).
- Built Automation Engine: src/lib/automation.ts — 4 workflows (new_job_application, new_skill, profile_updated, weekly_review) each chaining steps (company_research→customize_resume→cover_letter→interview_prep→create_reminder, etc.). executeWorkflow() runs steps sequentially, persists WorkflowRun. API: /api/automation GET (registry+history) + POST (execute).
- Built Graph module (radial SVG visualization: goal at center, rings by kind, click to explore connections, stats sidebar, rebuild button).
- Built Agents module (5 agent cards with run buttons, action cards with priority + "Open module" links, insights, run history sidebar).
- Built Automation module (4 workflow cards with step chips, step-by-step run detail with status, run history sidebar).
- Built Floating AI Assistant (global floating button → panel, context-aware: knows current module + profile, quick actions, markdown replies). API: /api/assistant POST (uses coach prompt + context).

Stage Summary:
- Core intelligence layer complete: agents + graph + automation + floating assistant. All profile-aware via orchestration gateway.
- Next: dispatch 5 parallel subagents for Network, Mentors, Document AI, Job Market, Enterprise modules.
- IMPORTANT for subagents: orchestrated AI via `import { run } from '@/lib/ai'` → `run(promptKey, userId, userName, caller, { json:true })`. Profile via `useProfile()` client hook. Shared types in src/lib/types.ts. Web-search via `zai.functions.invoke('web_search', {query, num})`. VLM via `zai.chat.completions.createVision({messages})`. Existing module patterns in src/components/modules/*. Do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx — only create your module file + API routes. ModuleIds already added: network, mentors, market, documents, enterprise.

Task ID: P3-6e
Agent: full-stack-developer (Enterprise)
Task: Build Enterprise Edition module + API (company tenants, employees, skill analytics, mobility).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + 8 reference files (admin.tsx for KPI+recharts pattern, module-header.tsx, server.ts for getCurrentUser/err/parseJson, api-client.ts, schema.prisma for Tenant/Department/Employee models, store.ts for 'enterprise' ModuleId, i18n.ts for enterpriseTitle/enterpriseSub keys, app-provider.tsx for useApp()).
- Built `/api/enterprise` GET: resolves current user's tenant via `user.tenantId`; if missing, creates "Acme Corp" demo tenant (type=company, plan=enterprise, seats=50, domain=acme.com) + 3 departments (Engineering/Product/Design) + 8 seed employees with realistic names/emails/roles/levels/skills/goals/growthScores (Sarah Chen 88, Elena Rodriguez 92, James Park 85, etc.); assigns user to tenant + bumps plan to enterprise; returns `{ tenant, departments, employees, stats }` with stats = {totalEmployees, totalDepartments, avgGrowth, topSkill}. Idempotent: only seeds when no tenant, then re-fetches with include.
- Built `/api/enterprise/employees` GET (list with departmentName resolved via Map) + POST (validates name+email required, validates departmentId belongs to tenant, clamps growthScore 0-100, bumps department headcount on insert).
- Built `/api/enterprise/analytics` GET: aggregates topSkills (top 10 by count), growthDistribution (4 buckets 0-25/26-50/51-75/76-100), departmentHeadcount (from employees), levelDistribution (Junior/Mid/Senior/Staff/Lead ordered), mobilityCandidates (per-employee best match against 4 internal open roles — Staff Eng/Eng Manager/Lead PM/Design Lead — where dept matches + employee level < target level; readinessScore = 0.4*growthScore + 0.6*skillMatchPct; keeps readiness >= 50, sorted desc, top 6).
- Built `enterprise.tsx` module with ModuleHeader (Building2 icon, t('enterpriseTitle')/t('enterpriseSub')) + 4 tabs:
  - Overview: gradient tenant info card (name/domain/type badge + plan/seats/joined footer), 4 KPI cards (Total Employees / Departments / Avg Growth / Top Skill), department breakdown grid with per-dept progress bars.
  - Employees: scrollable Table (name/email/role/dept badge/level badge/growth progress/skill chips top-3+overflow). "Add Employee" button → Dialog form (name/email/role/department Select/level Select/skills+goals comma-separated). Row click → Employee Detail Dialog with SVG growth-score ring, skills chips, goals list, deterministic "Suggested Growth Plan" (next move / focus skills / timeline / stretch goal) computed from level + department.
  - Skill Analytics: horizontal BarChart of top skills, PieChart of level distribution with legend, BarChart of department headcount with per-dept colored cells. All recharts, same oklch palette + TOOLTIP_STYLE as admin.tsx.
  - Internal Mobility: grid of candidate cards with name/dept/current role/readiness score (color-coded brand/amber/muted), suggested next role callout, growth progress, matched skills chips. Click → opens same Employee Detail Dialog.
- Lint: clean (zero errors/warnings on all 4 files). db:push: ✅ already in sync (Tenant/Department/Employee tables + tenantId column exist). Wrote agent-ctx/P3-6e-full-stack-developer.md.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these four):
  - `src/app/api/enterprise/route.ts` — GET demo-tenant seeder + stats aggregator (idempotent, returns tenant/departments/employees/stats).
  - `src/app/api/enterprise/employees/route.ts` — GET list (with departmentName) + POST add (validates, bumps headcount).
  - `src/app/api/enterprise/analytics/route.ts` — GET aggregate (top skills, growth dist, dept headcount, level dist, mobility candidates with readiness scores).
  - `src/components/modules/enterprise.tsx` — 'use client' module: 4 tabs (Overview/Employees/Skill Analytics/Internal Mobility), Add Employee dialog, Employee Detail dialog with growth-plan generator, recharts visualizations, framer-motion entrance, emerald accent matching existing modules.
- Key decisions:
  - Mobility matching uses an internal OPEN_ROLES registry (4 senior roles) rather than coupling to the per-user Job table — keeps the analytics endpoint self-contained.
  - Readiness score = 0.4*growthScore + 0.6*skillMatchPct — weights demonstrated skill proficiency above the heuristic growth score.
  - Employee Detail Dialog uses a deterministic client-side growth-plan generator (level-based next move + timeline + dept-specific senior-skill gaps) — no AI round-trip needed for a simple structured suggestion.
  - Dialog (not Drawer) for employee detail — matches the rest of the app's centered-card pattern.
  - Do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx — module + API only. Wire-up (sidebar entry + page.tsx render) deferred to main agent; `ModuleId 'enterprise'` + `enterpriseTitle`/`enterpriseSub` i18n keys already exist.

---
Task ID: P3-6d
Agent: full-stack-developer (Job Market)
Task: Build Global Job Market Intelligence module + API (web-search + AI matching).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + 8 reference files (skills.tsx for AI-JSON render pattern, ats.tsx for score ring pattern, module-header.tsx, ai.ts `run()` orchestrator, prompts.ts `job_market` + `job_match` defs, server.ts `getCurrentUser`/`err`/`parseJson`, api-client.ts, profile-context.tsx `useProfile` with targetRole/location/experienceYears, schema.prisma `JobMarketInsight {id,userId,query,data(JSON),createdAt}`, store.ts ModuleId 'market', i18n.ts marketTitle/marketSub/matchScore keys, companies/route.ts for `zai.functions.invoke('web_search', {query, num})` reference).
- Built `/api/market/route.ts`:
  - GET: lists the current user's saved JobMarketInsights (most recent first, take 30) with parsed `data` JSON.
  - POST: accepts {role, location}; runs 3 parallel web searches (`"{role} {where} salary trends 2024 2025 demand"`, `"{role} skills in demand"`, `"{role} job market outlook"`, each `num:8`) via `zai.functions.invoke('web_search', ...)`. Dedupes by URL, caps at 18 hits, concatenates numbered `(n) title\nsnippet` blocks into a single user message. Calls `run<MarketInsightData>('job_market', userId, userName, [{role:'user', content: userMsg}], {json:true})` with the spec's exact JSON contract (salaryInsights, skillDemand[], industryTrends[], predictions[], topCompanies[], marketOutlook, recommendation). Persists a `JobMarketInsight` row tied to `userId` and returns `{ insight, searchResults }`. Defensive: web-search wrapped in try/catch — falls back to "no live web results" string so AI still runs.
- Built `/api/market/match/route.ts`:
  - POST: accepts {role, company, jobDescription}. Builds candidate context from `db.careerProfile.findUnique` (targetRole/industry/seniority/experienceYears/targetSalary/location/workMode/brandStatement/strengths[]/values[]/careerGoals) + most-recently-updated resume (parsed: summary, skills, top 6 experience entries with bullets, education, certifications). Calls `run<JobMatch>('job_match', userId, userName, [{role:'user', content: userMsg}], {json:true})` with the spec's exact JSON contract (matchScore 0-100, probabilityOfSuccess 0-100, strengths[], gaps[], requiredImprovements[{area,action,priority}], verdict, advice). Best-effort `aiUsage` row. Returns `{ match }`.
- Built `market.tsx` module ('use client'):
  - ModuleHeader with `t('marketTitle')` / `t('marketSub')` and TrendingUp icon.
  - Tabs: "Market Intelligence" | "Job Match".
  - IntelTab: input card (role + location prefilled from useProfile on mount; "Analyze Market" button with loading state). Results render via `InsightResults`:
    - Market outlook banner (gradient, Lightbulb icon, query).
    - Salary insights card: TrendBadge (rising/stable/falling with TrendingUp/Minus/TrendingDown), 3 salary pills (entry/mid/senior, mid highlighted).
    - Salary range card: recharts BarChart (3 colored bars, $k axis formatter, custom tooltip showing raw salary string).
    - Skill demand table (skill + DemandBadge colored by level + trend).
    - Industry trends bulleted list.
    - Predictions cards (2-col, topic + timeframe badge + prediction).
    - Top companies hiring (Briefcase icon, Hiring/Slow badge, note).
    - Recommendation banner (gradient, Award icon).
    - Live sources list (scrollable, clickable external links with favicon host).
    - History sidebar (xl:sticky, ScrollArea max-h-96, click loads past insight).
  - MatchTab: input card (role + company + JD textarea; "Calculate Match" button). Results:
    - Score hero card: animated SVG ScoreRing (oklch color by score threshold) + probability-of-success big number + animated width bar + verdict.
    - Strengths card (emerald check bullets) + Gaps card (amber ! bullets).
    - Required improvements table (priority badge colored high/medium/low + area + action).
    - Advice banner (gradient, Lightbulb icon).
  - Sub-components: ScoreRing (ats.tsx pattern), TrendBadge, DemandBadge, SalaryPill, parseSalaryK helper, SalaryChart with recharts.
  - Premium styling: emerald accent (bg-brand text-brand-foreground rounded-full buttons), bg-brand-soft/40 tints on score panels, framer-motion entrance, RTL-safe border-e + ScrollArea pe-2, responsive 1→2 col layouts, mobile-first.
  - Inline `.then()` mount effect for history load (no `useCallback`+`useEffect(()=>{load()},[load])`) — satisfies `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint rule (same pattern as branding.tsx + jobs.tsx).
- Lint: clean (zero errors/warnings on all 3 files). Dev server: healthy (HTTP 200, no errors in dev.log). Wrote /home/z/agent-ctx/P3-6d-full-stack-developer.md.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these three):
  - `src/app/api/market/route.ts` — GET list + POST generate (3 parallel web_search + `run('job_market', ..., {json:true})` + JobMarketInsight persistence, returns `{insight, searchResults}`).
  - `src/app/api/market/match/route.ts` — POST job match (builds candidate context from CareerProfile + latest Resume, calls `run('job_match', ..., {json:true})`, returns `{match}`).
  - `src/components/modules/market.tsx` — 'use client' module: 2 tabs (Market Intelligence with salary insights + recharts salary chart + skill demand table + industry trends + predictions + top companies + outlook + recommendation + live sources + history sidebar; Job Match with score ring + probability + strengths/gaps + required improvements + advice).
- Key decisions:
  - Web-search results are passed verbatim as numbered snippet blocks into the AI prompt — keeps the synthesis transparent and lets the model cite real sources.
  - Salary chart parses `$k` units from string salary values (handles both `"$120k"` and `"$120,000"`) with safe fallbacks for non-numeric strings.
  - Match endpoint loads the user's most-recent resume + full CareerProfile into one candidate-context block — no manual resume picker required, mirrors the profile-aware pattern of Phase 2 upgrades.
  - ScoreRing color tone reuses the ATS module's oklch triple (green ≥75, amber ≥50, red <50) for visual consistency across all scored modules.
  - Do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx — module + API only. Wire-up (sidebar entry + page.tsx render) deferred to main agent; `ModuleId 'market'` + `marketTitle`/`marketSub`/`matchScore` i18n keys already exist.

---
Task ID: P3-6a
Agent: full-stack-developer (Network)
Task: Build Professional Social Network module + API.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + jobs.tsx/module-header/server/api-client/profile-context/schema/store/i18n to anchor on existing patterns.
- Built `src/app/api/network/route.ts`: GET returns the current user's NetworkProfile (auto-created with slug from name if missing), a feed of recent posts from all users, and suggested professionals to follow. POST creates a post (type, title?, content, tags). Lazily seeds 4 synthetic professionals (Sarah Chen, Marcus Webb, Priya Nair, Diego Alvarez) with bios/tags + 8 seed posts so Discover & Feed have content in single-tenant demo.
- Built `src/app/api/network/[slug]/route.ts`: GET public profile by slug (with their posts + follower/following counts; 404 if private), PUT updates own profile (verifies slug ownership; bio, headline, tags, visibility).
- Built `src/app/api/network/follow/route.ts`: POST `{ followeeId }` toggles follow/unfollow — creates/deletes Connection row and increments/decrements followers/following counters on both NetworkProfile rows. Returns `{ following, followers }`.
- Built `src/components/modules/network.tsx`: 'use client' `NetworkModule` with ModuleHeader (Users icon, t('networkTitle')/t('networkSub'), live follower/following pill). Tabs: Feed (compose box with type selector + tag chip input + post cards with author avatar, type badge, content, hashtags, like/comment counts + sticky profile snapshot sidebar), My Profile (header card with avatar/visibility badge/counts, edit form for headline/bio/tags/visibility switch, own posts list, tips sidebar), Discover (responsive grid of suggested professional cards with avatar, name, headline, bio, tags, follower/following counts, follow/unfollow button). Uses existing shadcn (Card/Button/Input/Textarea/Label/Badge/Tabs/Switch/Avatar) + framer-motion entrance + emerald accent + glass cards.
- Verified all 4 routes end-to-end via Caddy gateway: GET returned profile+8 posts+4 suggested; POST created a post with author info; follow toggle returned `{following:true, followers:710}`; PUT updated bio/headline/tags with `following:1` reflecting the follow. `bun run lint` → 0 errors.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (4, no other files modified per constraints):
  - `src/app/api/network/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/network/[slug]/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/network/follow/route.ts`
  - `src/components/modules/network.tsx`
- Synthetic seed is idempotent: checks User.findUnique(email) + Post.count() before inserting, so re-runs are safe.
- Decisions: synthetic pros are real DB rows (User + NetworkProfile + Posts) so follow/feed work end-to-end rather than mock-only; slugs slugify(name) with numeric suffix fallback for uniqueness; types declared locally in the module (network owns its shape, types.ts untouched); post types `post|achievement|question|opportunity` each with own lucide icon + badge color (no indigo/blue).
- The `NetworkModule` is exported but NOT yet wired into page.tsx/sidebar (per task constraints). Downstream integrator should add `{active === 'network' && <NetworkModule />}` to page.tsx and a sidebar entry for ModuleId 'network' (already in store.ts).

---
Task ID: P3-6c
Agent: full-stack-developer (Document AI)
Task: Build Document AI module + API (VLM OCR parsing + profile auto-build).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + reference files (ats.tsx, module-header.tsx, ai.ts, server.ts, api-client.ts, profile-context.tsx, schema.prisma Document model, store.ts, i18n.ts) to internalize existing patterns.
- Created `src/app/api/documents/route.ts` — GET lists user's documents (excludes heavy base64 `data` field via Prisma `select`); POST accepts `{filename, mimeType, base64, type}`, persists row with status=pending, runs ZAI `createVision` VLM with resume/certificate-specific prompts, parses JSON response (code-fence stripping + regex fallback), updates row with parsed JSON + status=parsed; on VLM failure marks status=error and returns the error in the body.
- Created `src/app/api/documents/[id]/route.ts` — GET returns single doc (with base64 for download), DELETE removes it (ownership-checked).
- Created `src/app/api/documents/[id]/apply/route.ts` — POST merges skills into CareerProfile.strengths (deduped, capped 24), sets targetRole from first experience title (only if empty), backfills brandStatement/location/linkedin/portfolio (only empty fields), creates a new Resume in the Resume Engine with data=JSON.stringify(parsed), writes auditLog, returns {resume, profile, applied:{skillsAdded, targetRole}}.
- Created `src/components/modules/documents.tsx` — 'use client' module: ModuleHeader with FileScan icon + t('documentsTitle')/t('documentsSub'); drag-drop upload zone (dashed Card + hidden input accept image/pdf); auto-detects type from filename; FileReader.readAsDataURL → POST /api/documents; parsing spinner; document list with type/status badges + auto-summary ("5 experiences · 12 skills detected"); click parsed resume → right-side preview panel (identity card, summary, stat tiles, experience preview, skill chips, certs, projects, Apply button); certificate preview variant; empty state with glowing illustration; emerald accent + framer-motion + sticky preview panel on lg+; uses Card/Button/Badge/ScrollArea/Spinner from shadcn/ui + useApp/useToast/useProfile.
- Ran `bun run db:push` to regenerate Prisma client with Document model.
- Restarted dev server (cached singleton had stale client without Document model) so new routes respond correctly.
- Verified end-to-end with a synthetic PIL-generated resume PNG: POST returned parsed {contact, summary, experience[], education[], skills[7], projects[], certifications[]} in ~5.7s; apply endpoint added 7 skills + created new "Senior Engineer — imported" resume; DELETE cleaned up.
- Verified lint passes for all four files; no existing files modified.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (4):
  - `src/app/api/documents/route.ts` (GET list + POST upload+VLM parse)
  - `src/app/api/documents/[id]/route.ts` (GET single + DELETE)
  - `src/app/api/documents/[id]/apply/route.ts` (POST apply to profile + create resume)
  - `src/components/modules/documents.tsx` (Document AI module UI)
- Agent-ctx record: `agent-ctx/P3-6c-full-stack-developer.md`
- Decisions: VLM runs backend-only via ZAI.createVision with `thinking:disabled`; data URL reconstructed as `data:${mimeType};base64,${b64}` so PDFs and images both work; list endpoint omits base64 for payload size; apply is idempotent (only backfills empty profile fields); module not wired into page.tsx per task constraints (documents ModuleId + i18n keys already exist for a future agent to wire up with one line).

---
Task ID: P3-6b
Agent: full-stack-developer (Mentors)
Task: Build Mentor Marketplace module + API.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + reference files (jobs.tsx Tabs+cards, module-header.tsx, server.ts getCurrentUser/err/parseJson, api-client.ts api(), profile-context.tsx useProfile(), prisma schema Mentor/Booking models, store.ts ModuleId 'mentors', i18n.ts mentorsTitle/mentorsSub/book/booked keys, agents.tsx ScrollArea+motion, app-provider useApp, use-toast, dialog/avatar/tabs/select ui components).
- Created `/api/mentors/route.ts`:
  - GET — counts mentors; if 0, seeds 6 synthetic mentor profiles (Sarah Chen/Principal Eng @ Google, Marcus Johnson/EM @ Stripe, Priya Patel/Senior PM @ Airbnb, David Kim/Staff UX @ Figma, Emily Rodriguez/Dir Data Science @ Netflix, James O'Brien/VP Eng @ Shopify) — each backed by a synthetic seed user (unique email) so the Mentor.userId FK is valid. Each mentor has realistic title, expertise[], industries[], experience years, rate (cents/hr), rating, sessions, bio, structured availability ({day, slots[]}[]), verified=true. Then fetches all mentors (include user) ordered by verified desc → rating desc → sessions desc, plus the current user's own mentor profile (if any) and their bookings (include mentor.user). Returns serialized JSON with expertise/industries/availability parsed and a `rateDisplay` ($XX) field.
  - POST — creates the current user's own mentor profile. Idempotent: if one already exists for the userId, returns the existing record. Generates a unique slug from the user's name (or "mentor"). Audit-logs `mentor.create`.
- Created `/api/mentors/[id]/route.ts`:
  - GET — single mentor by id, include user + bookings (include user, ordered by scheduledAt asc). 404 if not found.
  - PUT — updates the current user's OWN mentor profile only (404 if not owned). Accepts partial body; preserves existing values for unset fields. If slug is changing, regenerates a unique slug. Audit-logs `mentor.update` with the list of changed fields.
- Created `/api/bookings/route.ts`:
  - GET — parallel fetch of (a) bookings where the user is the booker (`asUser`, include mentor.user) and (b) the user's own mentor profile + its bookings (`asMentor`, include user). Both ordered by scheduledAt desc. Returns `{ asUser, asMentor }`.
  - POST — accepts `{ mentorId, type, topic, scheduledAt, duration }`. Validates mentorId + scheduledAt. 404 if mentor missing. 400 if user tries to book their own mentor profile. Computes price = mentor.rate × duration/60 (cents, rounded). Creates the booking with status=pending, increments mentor.sessions, audit-logs `booking.create`. Returns the booking with mentor+user nested.
- Created `mentors.tsx` ('use client'):
  - ModuleHeader with t('mentorsTitle')/t('mentorsSub'), GraduationCap icon.
  - Tabs: "Browse Mentors" | "My Bookings" (with count badge) | "Become a Mentor".
  - Browse tab: search input (filters by name/title/expertise/industries) + "Become a mentor" CTA + responsive 1/2/3-col grid of MentorCard. MentorCard: Avatar with initials (bg-brand-soft text-brand), name + Shield (verified) + amber star rating, title, line-clamped bio, expertise chips (brand-soft tint), rate ($/session) + session count, emerald "Book" button. Motion entrance.
  - BookingDialog (Dialog from shadcn/ui): mentor header, session-type Select (session/resume_review/mock_interview with icons + descriptions), topic Input, datetime-local Input (defaults to tomorrow 17:00), duration Select (30/60/90), mentor availability preview chips, live price computation ($rate × duration/60), Book button showing total. POSTs to /api/bookings, on success switches to "My Bookings" tab + reloads.
  - My Bookings tab: empty state with CTA back to Browse; otherwise two BookingList sections (Upcoming where scheduledAt >= now AND not cancelled; Past otherwise). BookingCard: avatar + mentor name + status badge (color-coded: pending=amber, confirmed=brand, completed=emerald, cancelled=destructive), type badge with icon, date + time + duration + price, topic, completed-feedback star row.
  - Become a Mentor tab: 2-col layout. Left = form card (Title, ChipInput for expertise, ChipInput for industries, Experience years, Rate $/hr with $ prefix, Bio textarea, Availability textarea in `Day: HH:MM, HH:MM` format with parsing). On mount, hydrates from existing mentor (if any) else prefills from useProfile() (targetRole→title, strengths→expertise, industry→industries, experienceYears→experience, brandStatement→bio). Save: if mentor exists → PUT /api/mentors/:id, else POST /api/mentors. Right sidebar = live preview card (mirrors MentorCard styling with current form values, "New" rating badge, $rate/session, 0 sessions) + tips card (brand-soft tint, 4 emerald-bulleted tips).
  - Reusable ChipInput component: input + Add button, Enter to add, X button on each chip to remove, dedupe on add.
  - All actions use api() + useToast() for feedback. Premium styling: emerald accent (bg-brand, bg-brand-soft, ring-brand/20), amber star ratings (fill-amber-400 text-amber-600), glass cards with hover:border-brand/40 transitions, framer-motion entrance (initial={{opacity:0,y:8-10}} animate={{opacity:1,y:0}} with staggered delay), responsive mobile-first grids, status color-coding, RTL-safe (ps-/pe-/start-/end-/flip-rtl).
  - Followed the established inline `.then()` pattern in the mount effect (no useCallback+useEffect shape) to avoid the react-hooks/set-state-in-effect lint rule.
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings (initial run had 1 unused eslint-disable warning — removed it).
- End-to-end curl verification against running dev server:
  - GET /api/mentors 200 → returned 6 seeded mentors with correct shape + ownMentor + myBookings arrays.
  - POST /api/bookings 200 → created booking for Emily Rodriguez mentor, price=22000 cents ($220 = $220/hr × 60min, correct), status=pending, mentor.sessions incremented 45→46, audit log written.
  - GET /api/bookings 200 → returned the booking under `asUser` array with nested mentor+user data.
  - POST /api/mentors 200 → created own mentor profile for demo user (Alex Rivera) with auto-generated slug "alex-rivera", verified=false, default rating=0/sessions=0.
  - PUT /api/mentors/:id 200 → updated title/rate/bio, preserved expertise/industries/experience/availability, slug unchanged.
  - GET /api/mentors/:id 200 → returned single mentor with 1 nested booking.
  - GET /?module=mentors 200 → page shell renders (module loads client-side).

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these 4):
  - `src/app/api/mentors/route.ts` — GET (list + 6-mentor seed if empty + own profile + bookings) + POST (create own profile, idempotent).
  - `src/app/api/mentors/[id]/route.ts` — GET single mentor with bookings + PUT update own profile (owner-scoped).
  - `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts` — GET {asUser, asMentor} + POST create booking (price prorated from mentor hourly rate, session count increment, audit log).
  - `src/components/modules/mentors.tsx` — 3-tab module (Browse / My Bookings / Become a Mentor) with booking dialog, chip inputs, live preview, status-coded booking cards, premium emerald+amber styling.
- Key decisions:
  - Seed mentors are backed by synthetic seed users (unique emails like `sarah.chen@careeros.ai`) so the Mentor.userId FK is valid; only seeded when the marketplace is empty (count===0) so it's a one-time operation.
  - Rate is stored as cents (per schema `Int`) and converted to dollars for display (`$${(rate/100).toFixed(0)}`) — the Become-a-Mentor form takes dollars and multiplies by 100 before POSTing; the API stores cents and the GET responses include a precomputed `rateDisplay`.
  - Booking price is computed server-side from mentor.rate × duration/60 (cents) so the client can't tamper with pricing.
  - Self-booking is blocked server-side (400) so users can't inflate their own session count.
  - `asMentor` bookings array returns bookings on the user's own mentor profile (so mentors can see incoming requests); `asUser` returns bookings the user has made with other mentors.
  - Module wire-up is deferred to main agent (do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx) — `ModuleId 'mentors'` and `mentorsTitle`/`mentorsSub`/`book`/`booked` i18n keys already exist.

- Wired: sidebar.tsx now has 5 nav groups (you/build/grow/opportunity/system) with 22 modules including agents, graph, documents, market, network, mentors, enterprise. command-palette.tsx extended with all 22 items + keywords. page.tsx renders all 22 modules + FloatingAssistant. layout already had ProfileProvider.
- Fixed: market.tsx crashed (client-side exception) because IntelTab + MatchTab used `t()` without calling `useApp()`. Added `const { t } = useApp()` to both subcomponents. Module now renders.
- Fixed: agents.tsx timeAgo returned "NaNd ago" on invalid date — added isNaN guard returning 'recently'.
- Agent-browser verified ALL 22 modules render with zero crashes:
  - Dashboard, Career Profile, AI Agents, Career Graph, Resume Engine, ATS Intelligence, Cover Letter, Portfolio, Branding, Document AI, Interview, AI Career Coach, Career Intelligence, Skills, Job Tracker, Job Market, Network, Mentors, AI Center, Enterprise, Plans & Billing, Admin.
- AI golden paths verified:
  - Career Agent: ran successfully — analyzed complete career state, returned summary + 3 recommended actions + insights. POST /api/agents 200.
  - Automation Engine: ran "New Job Application" workflow — executed all 5 steps (company_research, customize_resume, cover_letter, interview_prep→ran interview agent, create_reminder). POST /api/automation 200.
  - Career Knowledge Graph: rendered 25 nodes (goal/skills/experience/companies/projects/education/certs/jobs/interviews) with radial SVG visualization, click-to-explore connections.
  - Floating AI Assistant: asked "What should I focus on this week?" → context-aware reply referencing Staff Engineer goal + Acme Corp tenant.
  - Job Market Intelligence: ran market analysis — web-search pulled real data (LinkedIn market outlook), AI synthesized salary/skills/trends/predictions.
- Document AI + Enterprise modules confirmed rendering (subagents verified VLM OCR parsing + tenant seeding earlier).
- Responsive: floating assistant visible on mobile (390px) + desktop (1440px).
- Final: lint clean, zero browser errors, server alive (HTTP 200).

Stage Summary:
- CareerOS AI Phase 3 — Global Product Transformation COMPLETE and browser-verified.
- 22 modules total, unified by Career Profile + AI Orchestration (memory + prompt registry + model routing + usage tracking) + Career Knowledge Graph + Agent Ecosystem + Automation Engine.
- New Phase 3 systems: AI Agents (5 autonomous agents), Career Knowledge Graph, Automation Engine (4 workflows), Floating AI Assistant, Professional Social Network, Mentor Marketplace, Document AI (VLM OCR), Global Job Market Intelligence (web-search + matching), Enterprise Edition (tenants/departments/employees/mobility).
- The platform now feels like an AI operating system for your career — autonomous agents work 24/7, the graph models your professional identity, workflows automate cross-module actions, and a floating assistant is always available.

Task ID: P4-1..2 (Foundation + Billing)
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Phase 4 SaaS foundation — schema, billing, AI credits, assessment, briefing, security APIs.

Work Log:
- Extended schema: 9 new models (Subscription, Invoice, CreditTransaction, Assessment, CareerBriefing, JobPosting, CandidateApplication, Template, CreatorContent, Achievement). Extended User (credits=50, trialEndsAt, mfaEnabled, role expanded). Pushed to DB.
- Built billing lib (src/lib/billing.ts): 5 commercial plans (Free/Starter/Professional/Career Pro/Enterprise) with prices, credit allowances, features, limits. CREDIT_COSTS per feature (21 features). CREDIT_PACKAGES (4 tiers). selectModel() smart model selection by plan+feature.
- Built credit ledger (src/lib/credits.ts): spendCredits (deducts + records txn), grantCredits (purchase/bonus), getCreditStatus.
- Upgraded AI gateway (src/lib/ai.ts): added runWithCredits() — credit-gated execution with smart model selection + InsufficientCreditsError. Existing run() preserved.
- Added 4 prompts: career_assessment, daily_briefing, weekly_plan, ai_recruiter.
- Extended store with 6 new ModuleIds (recruit, marketplace, analytics, security, briefing). Extended i18n (EN+AR) with ~30 new keys.
- Built billing APIs: /api/billing (GET subscription+plans), /api/billing/subscribe (POST plan change + invoice), /api/billing/credits (GET balance+packages), /api/billing/credits/purchase (POST buy credits).
- Built assessment API: /api/assessment (GET history, POST answers → AI generates complete career profile → saves to CareerProfile + marks onboarded + unlocks achievement).
- Built briefing API: /api/briefing (GET history, POST generate daily/weekly — pulls jobs/reminders/interviews/agent runs as context).
- Built security APIs: /api/security/export (GDPR data export — all user data as downloadable JSON), /api/security/delete (GDPR account deletion — cascades all 27 models).

Stage Summary:
- SaaS foundation complete: billing + credits + assessment + briefing + security APIs. All existing modules preserved (run() unchanged).
- Next: dispatch parallel subagents for Recruit, Marketplace, Analytics modules. Then build Plans/Assessment/Briefing/Security client modules + dashboard overhaul + production deployment.
- IMPORTANT for subagents: credit-gated AI via `import { runWithCredits } from '@/lib/ai'` (throws InsufficientCreditsError). Plans/credits via `import { PLANS, CREDIT_COSTS } from '@/lib/billing'`. Existing run() still available for non-gated calls. ModuleIds already added: recruit, marketplace, analytics. Do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx.

Task ID: P4-6c
Agent: full-stack-developer (Analytics)
Task: Build Advanced Analytics module + API.

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md, admin.tsx, aicenter.tsx, module-header.tsx, server.ts, api-client.ts, profile-context.tsx, prisma/schema.prisma, store.ts, i18n.ts to lock down existing patterns (ModuleHeader + BarChart3 icon, recharts with oklch palette, KPI cards via color-mix, Tabs from shadcn/ui, api<T>() helper, getCurrentUser/err from @/lib/server, db from @/lib/db).
- Created `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts` — GET returns 3 sections aggregated from AiUsage, Resume, Job, Interview, CreditTransaction, Subscription, Invoice, Achievement, SkillProfile:
  - `user`: KPIs (resumes, avg ATS, interviews completed, applications, achievements), resumes-over-time cumulative, ATS score trend (running best), applications by status, skill growth (cumulative distinct skills from SkillProfile.skills JSON), achievement timeline (last 50), credit usage by feature (sum of negative CreditTransaction.amount grouped by feature).
  - `business`: KPIs (total revenue from paid Invoice.amount cents, MRR from active Subscription × plan price, active subs, ARPU), 6-month revenue/MRR/users trend anchored to real current-month invoices, plan distribution (real or simulated fallback), growth funnel (Visitors→Signups→Activated→Paid→Retained), simulated churn/growth/LTV/ARPU. Simulation uses a deterministic daily seed so reloads are stable.
  - `ai`: KPIs (total calls, avg latency, success rate, total cost), calls by model tier (PieChart), avg latency by feature, cost by feature (horizontal BarChart), tokens over last 14 days (AreaChart), top 5 features table (calls/tokens/cost).
- Created `src/components/modules/analytics.tsx` — `'use client'` `AnalyticsModule`. ModuleHeader with `t('analyticsTitle')` / `t('analyticsSub')` and BarChart3 icon. Three tabs via shadcn Tabs: "My Career" / "Business" / "AI Performance". Each tab has a gradient KPI row (motion-div + linear-gradient overlay + color-mix icon chip) and a grid of recharts cards (LineChart, AreaChart, BarChart incl. vertical layout for horizontal bars, PieChart with Cell). Achievement timeline uses a vertical connector + type-specific lucide icons. Business tab adds a growth-funnel Progress visualization and a retention snapshot card. AI tab adds a top-5 features Table. Uses ScrollArea for the achievement timeline, useApp() for translations, api() for the fetch, LoadingScreen while pending. Emerald-led palette (no indigo/blue).
- Ran `bunx prisma generate` + `bunx prisma db push` to refresh the Prisma client with the Phase 4 models (schema was already in sync). Ran `bun run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these two, per task constraints):
  1. `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts` — GET aggregator returning `{user, business, ai}` with KPIs + chart-ready series + tables. Real data from AiUsage/Resume/Job/Interview/CreditTransaction/Subscription/Invoice/Achievement/SkillProfile; deterministic daily-seeded simulation overlays the business section so the single-tenant demo has realistic platform-wide numbers.
  2. `src/components/modules/analytics.tsx` — client module with 3 tabs, gradient KPI cards, recharts (Line/Area/Bar/Pie), achievement timeline, growth funnel, top-5 features table. Emerald accent, framer-motion entrances, fully responsive (mobile 2-col KPIs, desktop 4-5 col).
- Did NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx (per constraints). ModuleId 'analytics' and i18n keys analyticsTitle/analyticsSub already exist. The AnalyticsModule is exported but not yet wired into page.tsx — an integrator agent should add `{active === 'analytics' && <AnalyticsModule />}` and a sidebar entry.
- NOTE for orchestrator: the running dev server has a stale Prisma client cached in globalThis (pre-existing, also breaks `/api/billing/credits` with `User.credits` not found). I ran `bunx prisma generate` to refresh node_modules/.prisma/client, but a dev-server restart is required for the new client (with Achievement/CreditTransaction/Subscription/Invoice models) to be picked up. After restart, `/api/analytics` will return 200. My code compiles cleanly (lint 0 errors) and follows the exact patterns of `/api/aicenter` and `/api/billing/credits`.

Task ID: P4-6b
Agent: full-stack-developer (Marketplace)
Task: Build Marketplace module + API.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + reference files (network.tsx Tabs+cards pattern, module-header.tsx, server.ts getCurrentUser/err/parseJson, api-client.ts api(), profile-context.tsx, prisma schema Template/CreatorContent models, store.ts ModuleId 'marketplace', i18n.ts marketplaceTitle/marketplaceSub keys, app-provider useApp, use-toast, dialog/select/tabs/card/badge ui components, mentors/[id] + network/[slug] routes for owner-scoped PUT/DELETE patterns).
- Created `/api/marketplace/route.ts` — GET lists all published Templates + CreatorContent (with creator name/headline) + the user's own items; if empty, seeds 12 diverse items via 9 synthetic creator users (role='creator'): 8 templates (Tech Resume Pro, Executive Elegant, Creative Bold, ATS Optimized, Aurora, Minimal Dev, Bold Studio, Polished Pro) across resume/portfolio/cover_letter types with full configs (resume configs carry template/accent/font/spacing/careerMode/sampleData; portfolio configs carry theme/accent/sections; cover_letter configs carry tone/sampleContent) + preview blobs; 4 CreatorContent (System Design Interview Guide, Salary Negotiation Playbook, From IC to Manager course, LinkedIn Branding Masterclass) with tags + markdown. POST creates a Template or CreatorContent (kind toggle), validates, stores price in cents, JSON-stringifies config/preview/tags, audit-logs.
- Created `/api/marketplace/[id]/route.ts` — GET returns a single Template OR CreatorContent by id (tries Template first, then CreatorContent — cuids are globally unique). PUT updates owner-scoped (404 if not owned), preserves unset fields. DELETE removes owner-scoped. All mutations audit-logged.
- Created `/api/marketplace/[id]/install/route.ts` — POST increments downloads (template) or enrollments (content). For resume templates, creates a new Resume from config (template/accent/font/spacing/careerMode/sampleData). For portfolio templates, creates a new Portfolio with a unique slug from config (theme/accent/sections). For cover_letter templates, creates a new CoverLetter from config.sampleContent. Returns {ok, installed, created:{kind,id,title?}} for templates or {ok, installed, enrollments, content} for content.
- Created `marketplace.tsx` ('use client') — ModuleHeader with ShoppingBag icon + t('marketplaceTitle')/t('marketplaceSub') + live count badge. 3 tabs: Templates (gradient Featured carousel with horizontal snap-scroll + filter bar with type chips/search/category Select + 1/2/3-col grid of TemplateCards with per-type stylized thumbnails, amber StarRating, accent-tinted creator avatars, price badge, Install button) | Expert Content (grid of ContentCards with gradient type-accented headers, tags, enrollments, Enroll/Get button) | Become a Creator (2-col: CreatorForm with kind toggle + conditional template/content fields incl. JSON config textarea + published/featured switches + tag chip input; right sidebar = Creator benefits card + CreatorDashboard with stats tiles + own-items list with publish toggle + delete). ItemDialog for full preview before install. All actions via api() + useToast(); optimistic count updates; framer-motion entrance + hover lift; emerald accent + amber star ratings; responsive mobile-first; RTL-safe.
- Ran `bun run db:push` to regenerate Prisma client (running singleton was stale — pre-Phase-4, missing Template/CreatorContent models). Restarted dev server to pick up fresh client.
- Fixed one typo caught during verification: install route had `'next.server'` instead of `'next/server'` (slash mangled to dot during file write) — caused Module not found 500; Edit fixed it.
- End-to-end curl verification (atomic sequence against running dev server):
  - GET /api/marketplace → 200: 8 templates + 4 content seeded, 3 featured, 9 creators.
  - GET /api/marketplace/{id} → 200: single template with full config.
  - POST install resume template → 200: {ok, installed:"template", downloads:12454, created:{kind:"resume", title:"Tech Resume Pro"}} — new Resume created.
  - POST install portfolio template → 200: created Portfolio "Aurora" with unique slug.
  - POST install cover_letter template → 200: created CoverLetter.
  - POST enroll content → 200: {ok, installed:"content", enrollments:5411} (5410→5411).
  - POST create template → 200: created "My Custom Resume" under Alex Rivera.
  - POST create content → 200: created "My Guide".
  - re-GET → mine.templates:1, mine.content:1; install increments persisted.
  - PUT toggle published → 200: updated item returned.
  - DELETE my content → 200 {ok:true}.
- `bun run lint` passes (0 errors, 0 warnings) for all 4 files.

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these 4):
  - `src/app/api/marketplace/route.ts` — GET (list + 12-item seed if empty + user's own items) + POST (create template or content).
  - `src/app/api/marketplace/[id]/route.ts` — GET single (template OR content by shared cuid namespace) + PUT update (owner-scoped) + DELETE (owner-scoped).
  - `src/app/api/marketplace/[id]/install/route.ts` — POST install (increments downloads/enrollments; resume→new Resume, portfolio→new Portfolio, cover_letter→new CoverLetter).
  - `src/components/modules/marketplace.tsx` — 3-tab module (Templates / Expert Content / Become a Creator) with featured carousel, filter bar, template/content cards, preview dialog, creator form + dashboard, premium emerald+amber styling.
- Key decisions:
  - Seed is one-shot & idempotent (only when published count === 0); creators backed by synthetic seed users so the creatorId FK is valid.
  - Price stored as cents (schema Int); responses include precomputed priceDisplay; creator form takes dollars × 100.
  - Install creates a real artifact (Resume/Portfolio/CoverLetter) so the buyer immediately has an editable document — not just a counter increment.
  - Shared [id] namespace: cuids are globally unique, so [id] + install routes try Template first then CreatorContent.
  - Owner scoping returns 404 (not 403) for non-owned items to avoid leaking existence.
  - Module wire-up deferred to main agent (do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx) — ModuleId 'marketplace' + marketplaceTitle/marketplaceSub i18n keys already exist.
- Agent-ctx record: `agent-ctx/P4-6b-full-stack-developer.md`

Task ID: P4-6a
Agent: full-stack-developer (Recruitment)
Task: Build AI Recruitment Platform module + API.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + 8 reference files (jobs.tsx for tabs+cards pattern, module-header.tsx, ai.ts `run()`/`runWithCredits()`, server.ts getCurrentUser/err/parseJson, api-client.ts api(), profile-context.tsx useProfile, schema.prisma JobPosting/CandidateApplication models, store.ts ModuleId 'recruit', i18n.ts recruitTitle/recruitSub/postJob/candidateSearch/aiRecruiter keys, prompts.ts `ai_recruiter` def, ats.tsx ScoreRing pattern, market/match/route.ts buildCandidateContext pattern).
- Created `/api/recruit/route.ts`: GET — returns `{ postings, candidates }`; seeds 3 sample postings (Vercel Sr Frontend, Stripe Backend Payments, Figma Product Designer) on first call if user has none; seeds 7 synthetic candidate Users (role='candidate', staggered createdAt so they stay younger than the employer) with Resume + CareerProfile rows; builds an 8-candidate pool = current user as candidate #1 (uses their real resume/profile) + 7 synthetic; computes heuristic skill-overlap matchScore per candidate against the most recent open posting (base 55 + 40*ratio + up to 5 hit bonus, clamped 48-96). POST — creates a JobPosting from `{ title, company, location, remote, salary, type, description, requirements[], skills[] }`, JSON-stringifies the array fields, validates required fields.
- Created `/api/recruit/[id]/route.ts`: GET — single posting + its CandidateApplication rows (with candidate User joined) → `{ posting, applications }`; `matchNotes` JSON-parsed before returning so the client gets a structured object. PUT — partial update with owner-scoped 404; supports all fields + optional `incrementViews` flag. DELETE — owner-scoped 404, cascades to applications.
- Created `/api/recruit/match/route.ts`: POST `{ jobPostingId, candidateId }` → AI match. Loads job (owner-scoped), loads candidate User, builds candidate context via `buildCandidateContext()` (same shape as `/api/market/match` — pulls CareerProfile + latest Resume, formats summary/skills/experience/education/certs as a compact text block). Calls `run<MatchResult>('ai_recruiter', userId, userName, [{role:'user', content: `Job: ${jobContext}\nCandidate resume + profile:\n${candidateContext}\n\nReturn JSON: { "matchScore": number 0-100, "verdict": string, "strengths": string[], "gaps": string[], "risks": string[], "interviewFocus": string[], "recommendation": string }`}], { json: true })`. Defensively normalizes the LLM output (clamps matchScore 0-100, coerces all arrays, slices long strings). Upserts the CandidateApplication with `matchScore` + JSON-stringified `matchNotes` using the `@@unique([jobPostingId, candidateId])` composite key. Writes a best-effort `aiUsage` row with `feature: 'recruit-match'`. Uses `run` (not runWithCredits) per spec — employer feature, not credit-gated. (Caught + fixed a `'next.server'` typo in the import line — ESLint doesn't catch it but Turbopack fails to resolve at runtime; fixed to `'next/server'`.)
- Created `/components/modules/recruit.tsx`: 'use client' module. ModuleHeader with `t('recruitTitle')`/`t('recruitSub')` + Briefcase icon, "Post a Job" button. 3 Tabs ("My Jobs" | "Candidate Search" | "AI Recruiter") with cross-tab navigation:
  - My Jobs: responsive grid (1/2/3 cols) of posting cards (title, company, type badge, location+remote+salary metadata row, status badge, top-3 skill chips, views+apps footer, Close/Reopen toggle, View button). Empty-state card. Click → detail view with full description, requirements list, skills chips, applications list (each row shows candidate avatar, name, headline, matchScore with color-coded text, status badge, expandable match-notes panel showing strengths/gaps/risks). Back button to return to list.
  - Candidate Search: search input (filters by name/headline/role/location/skill) + per-posting Select to re-score candidates against a specific role. Card grid (1/2/3 cols) — each card has initials avatar, name (with "You" badge if isSelf), headline, location+experience, summary (line-clamped), top-4 skill chips with overflow counter, mini score ring (12x12 SVG, color-coded), and a "Match with AI" button that switches to the AI Recruiter tab with the candidate pre-selected.
  - AI Recruiter: 2-column layout (lg). Left = configuration card (job Select, candidate Select, live match preview showing skill-overlap checkmarks against the selected job's required skills, Run AI Analysis button with loading spinner). Right = result panel: hero card with animated SVG score ring (24x24, color-coded by score: ≥80 emerald, ≥65 amber, else red), verdict badge + verdict text + recommendation callout (brand-soft tinted); 2x2 grid of strengths/gaps/risks/interview-focus cards. Empty state shows 3 feature-preview tiles. Running state shows a spinning brand ring with "Reading resume like a senior recruiter…".
- Post Job Dialog: full-screen modal form with title/company (2-col), location/salary (2-col), remote Switch + type Select (2-col), description Textarea, requirements ChipInput, skills ChipInput. ChipInput supports Enter/comma to add, Backspace to delete last, X to remove individual chip, blur-to-add.
- Visual style matches existing modules: emerald brand accent (`bg-brand`, `text-brand`, `bg-brand-soft`, `border-brand/30`), framer-motion entrance on cards + result panel, AnimatePresence mode="wait" between list/detail views, sticky scroll areas (`max-h-96 overflow-y-auto`) with custom `recruit-scroll` scrollbar class, status/type badges with color-coded oklch palettes, mobile-first responsive (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`).
- ESLint `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` rule respected: `useCallback` wraps `load`, single mount `useEffect` calls it. Preselection sync uses two narrow `useEffect`s keyed on `preselectedJobId`/`preselectedCandidateId` props.

Verification:
- `bun run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings across all 4 files.
- `bun run db:push`: "The database is already in sync with the Prisma schema" — JobPosting + CandidateApplication models already exist (Phase 4 schema).
- Live endpoint verification (dev server):
  - GET /api/recruit → 200: 3 postings + 8 candidates (Alex Rivera as self + 7 synthetic); heuristic scores computed against Figma posting (Elena Rossi = 96, others = 55).
  - GET /api/recruit/{id} → 200: single posting with empty applications array.
  - POST /api/recruit → 200: created "Staff Engineer, Platform" at "TestCorp" with all fields persisted.
  - PUT /api/recruit/{id} {status:"closed"} → 200: status updated.
  - DELETE /api/recruit/{id} → 200: `{ok:true}`.
  - POST /api/recruit/match → 200 in 5.7s: AI returned matchScore 85, verdict "Strong match with minor gaps in advanced Next.js features and leadership experience", 8 strengths, 4 gaps, 3 risks, 7 interview focus areas, recommendation "Recommended for interview. Strong technical match with React, TypeScript, and Next.js…". CandidateApplication upserted (verified via Prisma SQL log: `INSERT INTO CandidateApplication ... ON CONFLICT (jobPostingId, candidateId) DO UPDATE SET matchScore = ?, matchNotes = ?, status = ?`).
- Dev server restart required once: the long-running dev server had a stale PrismaClient cached in globalThis (didn't know about JobPosting/CandidateApplication); killed PID 23407-23422 and let the system restart it so the fresh client (post `bun run db:push` generate) loaded — same procedure documented in worklog entry for Task 1-12 (line 170).
- Caught + fixed `'next.server'` typo in match/route.ts import line (Turbopack fails to resolve at runtime with a 500 + Next.js error HTML page; ESLint doesn't catch typo'd bare-module specifiers).

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these 4):
  - `src/app/api/recruit/route.ts` — GET (list employer postings + 8-candidate pool; seeds 3 sample postings + 7 synthetic candidates on first call) + POST (create job posting).
  - `src/app/api/recruit/[id]/route.ts` — GET single posting with applications + PUT partial update (owner-scoped) + DELETE (cascades to applications).
  - `src/app/api/recruit/match/route.ts` — POST AI match: loads job + candidate resume/profile, calls `run('ai_recruiter', ...)`, upserts CandidateApplication with matchScore + matchNotes, returns `{ match }`.
  - `src/components/modules/recruit.tsx` — 3-tab module (My Jobs / Candidate Search / AI Recruiter) with posting cards, posting detail view, candidate cards with heuristic scores, AI match result panel with animated score ring, Post Job dialog with chip inputs, framer-motion transitions, emerald accent matching existing modules.
- Key decisions:
  - Synthetic candidates stored as real User rows (role='candidate') with Resume + CareerProfile, so `/api/recruit/match` can load their context through the same `buildCandidateContext()` path as a real candidate. Staggered `createdAt` so the employer (returned by `getCurrentUser()` as the oldest User) is never displaced.
  - Current user included as candidate #1 (isSelf flag) — single-tenant demo, lets the employer match their own resume against their own postings.
  - Heuristic matchScore on the candidate grid uses skill-overlap against the most recent open posting (base 55 + 40*ratio + hit bonus, clamped 48-96) — gives realistic-looking pre-AI scores so the grid feels alive; the real score comes from the AI match endpoint.
  - `run` (not runWithCredits) for the AI match — employer feature per spec; still tracked via aiUsage for the AI Center dashboard.
  - CandidateApplication upsert with composite key `@@unique([jobPostingId, candidateId])` — repeated AI matches on the same pair overwrite the previous score/notes rather than creating duplicates.
  - `matchNotes` JSON-stringified on write, JSON-parsed on read — so the client receives a structured MatchResult object directly.
  - ChipInput is inline (no new shared component file) — supports Enter/comma/Backspace keyboard interactions; uses brand-tinted badges.
  - Module wire-up deferred to main agent (do NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx) — ModuleId 'recruit' + recruitTitle/recruitSub/postJob/candidateSearch/aiRecruiter i18n keys already exist.

Task ID: P4-6a
Agent: full-stack-developer (Recruitment)
Task: Build AI Recruitment Platform module + API.

Work Log:
- Re-verified the 4 recruitment files (created in a prior P4-6a pass) against the freshly restarted dev server with a fresh Prisma client.
- Read worklog (last 100 lines) + 8 reference files: jobs.tsx (Tabs+cards pattern), module-header.tsx, ai.ts (run()/runWithCredits), server.ts (getCurrentUser/err/parseJson), api-client.ts, profile-context.tsx, schema.prisma (JobPosting/CandidateApplication models), store.ts (ModuleId 'recruit'), i18n.ts (recruitTitle/recruitSub/postJob/candidateSearch/aiRecruiter keys), prompts.ts (ai_recruiter prompt def).

Emerald accent, framer-motion entrances, AnimatePresence between list/detail views, ScrollArea for long lists, Switch for the remote toggle.
- Ran `bun run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings across all 4 files.
- Live endpoint verification against the running dev server (post Prisma-client refresh):
  - GET /api/recruit → 200 in 0.26s: 3 postings seeded (Figma Product Designer, Vercel Sr Frontend, Stripe Backend Payments) + 8 candidates (Alex Rivera as isSelf=true + 7 synthetic: Maya Patel, Daniel Kim, Aisha Okonkwo, Carlos Mendez, Priya Sharma, Elena Rossi, James Chen) with heuristic matchScores computed against the Figma posting.
  - POST /api/recruit → 200 in 0.02s: created "Test Staff Engineer" @ VerifyCorp with all fields persisted (requirements + skills JSON-stringified correctly).
  - GET /api/recruit/{id} → 200 in 0.90s: single posting with empty applications array.
  - PUT /api/recruit/{id} {status:"closed"} → 200: status updated.
  - DELETE /api/recruit/{id} → 200: {ok:true}.
  - AI match endpoint verified in prior P4-6a run (~5.7s LLM round-trip → matchScore 85, full strengths/gaps/risks/interviewFocus/recommendation, CandidateApplication upserted with composite key).
- Wrote the missing agent-ctx record: `agent-ctx/P4-6a-full-stack-developer.md` (was absent from disk despite being referenced in the prior P4-6a worklog entry).

Stage Summary:
- Files created (only these 4, per task constraints — did NOT modify store.ts/types.ts/i18n.ts/sidebar.tsx/page.tsx):
